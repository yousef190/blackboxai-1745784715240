# Secure Auth System

## Project Overview
The Secure Auth System is a production-ready Node.js application that provides an authentication framework with support for both manual login and OAuth via GitHub. This system is designed to handle user sessions securely and includes protection mechanisms against CSRF attacks.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- A PostgreSQL database for storing user information and sessions.

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-auth-system.git
cd secure-auth-system
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies
Run the following command to install the required packages:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
```
Make sure to replace `your_database_connection_string` and `your_session_secret` with your actual database URL and a secret for session management.

## Usage

### Running the Application
You can start the server in development mode using:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Alternatively, for production, use:
```bash
npm start
```
The application will start listening on the port specified by the environment variable `PORT` or default to 3000.

### Accessing the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the login page where you can log in with either manual credentials or through GitHub OAuth.
